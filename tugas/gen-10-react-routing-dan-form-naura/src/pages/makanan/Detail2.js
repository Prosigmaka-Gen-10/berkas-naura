            Known as soufflé cheesecake in Japan and cotton cheesecake or Japanese cheesecake outside of Japan, this light and fluffy dessert is made by incorporating whisked egg whites into the cake mixture (eggs, milk, sugar, cream cheese), and the combination is then baked in a bain-marie.
            The Japanese cheesecake is more fluffy and sponge-like than regular cheesecake, and it's sometimes eaten cold, but most people prefer to eat it straight out of the oven while it's still hot, so it almost melts in the mouth. It was created by a Japanese chef Tomotaro Kuzuno who went to Germany in the 1960s and found käsekuchen, a type of German cheesecake.
