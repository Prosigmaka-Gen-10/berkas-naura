            Namagashi, meaning raw sweets, is a Japanese sweet and a type of wagashi, consisting of natural ingredients such as fruit jellies or sweetened bean paste. It is considered an edible piece of art due to its beautiful design, reflecting seasonal and natural shapes such as flowers and leaves.
            Namagashi is especially popular during Japanese tea ceremonies, and because it is the most delicate of all types of wagashi and made daily, it must be consumed while it is still fresh, preferably accompanied by a cup of refreshing matcha tea. Today, every confectionery store in Japan usually has its own collection of unique, elegant, seasonal namagashi.
